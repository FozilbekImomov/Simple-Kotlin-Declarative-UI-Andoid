Naturally, the main ingredient will be flour from two units of wheat, and bottles of milk will also appear in the game. You can't just take and pour milk from buckets into bottles. There is no such possibility in the game, so players will have to resort to crafting. Bucket milk is divided into eight parts. Accordingly, you will need 8 units of empty bottles. Milk can be poured back, no need to put the cake on the table to eat. It is enough to place the cake in the crafting inventory to get four pieces of the cake. The bottle of vanilla is not yet available for crafting. To get it, you need to enter the command \/ give @s sweetfoods: vanilla_extract in the chat. Commands for other items are also available so as not to waste time on crafting. Secondary sweets The next step is to create the sweets themselves. The first in line were the cookies. Sweetness is crafted from two flour and one sugar, and biscuits will be used to craft an ice cream cone. Place the V-shaped cookies in your inventory to get a cone. Chocolate is obtained by using 3 bottles of milk, flour, 2 units of cocoa and, of course, 3 units of sugar. Next in line is ice cream. Three types of ice cream, which differ only in the product in the middle. Choose your ice cream from three options: Chocolate Ice Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream and Berry Ice Cream. From three ice creams you can create one that will give players special effects randomly. Frostbite: with a probability of 80% the player will receive a slowdown effect for 10 seconds after eating. Inspiration: There is a 20% chance that the player will receive a Power effect for 2 minutes after consuming ice cream. Experimental gameplay must be enabled in the map settings",
